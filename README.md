A Timezone OSX application (10.7 Target) 
Will be used to set Count downs and see CDT,PDT,MDT,EDT zones.
It can already adjust itself based on your time zone.

Sorry no support yet for any non listed timezones it will alert you and then close the application.

This is done since I only support the updating of all the times for the zones listed and it is otherwise application breaking.

App Example
========
Transparent Black backgrounded window with no bars. Uses my global header file to define colors of labels and background. All images are 65% transparent background when actually run except if you invert the window then it becomes a white background with a 85% opacity
